named links_db with syntax:

name of serial\http://link/to/episodes/list\name of file in which will info save\
-------------------------------------------------
Symbol "\" must be because it's delimiter for program.

                              WHAT YOU NEED FOR INSTALL.
First - this program use libcurl - so you should have headers file of this library
Second - cmake (need for compilation)

                              HOWTO INSTALL

Also in tarball there is compiled binary file.

                              HOWTO USE
For example we have string in file links_db :
--------------------------------links_db-------------------------------
serial\link\file_name\
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

programm will save all info about serial in file_name
Now we want know about this serial we should type:

imdb_check -s serial

or

imdb_check -s rial 

or

imdb_check -s seria

you can type not full name of serial

program will download info and print info, but if we want no download info (and if we
have file_name in directory) just type:

imdb_check -d -s serial

and it will use downloaded file_name, but if we need info only about season 4 of this serial then type:

imdb_check -d -s serial -S 4

and program will print info only about season 4. So for option "S" you only need nubmer of season.

ENJOY!!
